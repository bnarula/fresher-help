### But back in 2013,
This is how I was:
- no campus placement
- no college brand name
- only 60% aggregate in BTech

### Now in 2021, 
I take 2 interviews a week on average to help our recruitment team **hire** good Software Developers. 
And I meet different types of people I interview. I observe their
- attitude
- skillset
- curiousity
- interests
