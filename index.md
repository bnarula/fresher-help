My name is **Bhavya Narula** and I am here for your help. 
I am now working in a well known Software Development company in Bengaluru, India. 

### But back in 2013,
This is how I was:
- no campus placement
- no college brand name
- only 60% aggregate in BTech

### Now in 2021, 
I take atleast 2 interviews a week to help our recruitment team **hire** good Software Developers. On very high level, we observe their following qualities:
- attitude, curiousity, other interests
- skillset

### The demand of Software Engineers is at all time high in 2021. Software has been that field that came to further boom as the world got hit by the Coronavirus. 

If you are about to start your career in IT in India, but haven't been able to get hired on campus placements, reach out to me. Let's start by [Connecting with me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhavya-narula). Ping me on LinkedIn and I can provide you some bunch of _GYAAN_. Let's have that conversation to get you to kickstart your career. [...read more about how can I help you](https://bnarula.github.io/fresher-help/how-can-i-help-read-more)
