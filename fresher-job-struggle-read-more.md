## The Fresher Job Scenario in India (Software Engineer)

I now know that the system is broken, the fresher hiring is done by a bunch of people who think they have achieved so greatly in life that they want to bully every other candidate if he/she doesn't what they know. I was once asked the signature of HTTPServlet parameterized constructor in Java. To be true, nobody needs to know the fucking signature of the class. Everyone got a IDE to work with. Such people tend to google top 10 questions of the topic they know and put the same in front of the candidate, expecting them to answer in the same language they can check on google. 

The people from the Recruitment team or no better. They would ask the cliched questions again and again but will not even try to explore if the candidate can bring something other than the usuals to the table. Well in a team that is tasked to delivery a software, not all of them needs to be perfect on the tech-stack. Some of them might bring their organisation skills to the table. Without organisations skills in anyone on the team, the project will never go as per plan. 

That being said, if we wish to fix the broken system, first thing we got to do is enter the system. And for that we have to have patience that some company will come across our path, that tries to value what is actually needed for the job.

It is so hard to get a call for an interview for a fresher. I still remember spending around 5-6K on getting paid subscription to both naukri.com and monster.com. And there wasn't a single call they got to me. eLitmus used to be the only genuine option in our days, I don't know if it still is.
