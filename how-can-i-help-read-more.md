### As I was talking about what I observe in Interviews I take on weekly basis:
- Most of them are not really interested in software world. They are here just for the sake of doing a job.  It doesn't take me long to entangle them into their own words. That's because in software world you cannot know everything, it is very vast and fast moving. What you got to have is the curuosity to know more. You need to have the understanding that this is not just another subject you studied in Engineering. This is the real world of 2021 and this world is run by code. 
- Other, while they are interested but haven't spend enough hours on building the basic most of skills. Usually, it's after you practice and fail a lot before being able to write the first program on your own. And then you practice a bit more, which is when suddenly you find yourself addicted to see the correct output print out on the console. If a BTech pass student spends enough hours and persistance on learning a programming language, he will find himself way ahead of the lakhs and lakhs of engineers that pass out of colleges every year.
