## How can I be of any help to you?

### As I was talking about what I observe in the Interviews I take on weekly basis:
- Most of them are not really interested in software world. They are here just for the sake of doing a job.  What you need to understand that this is not just another subject you studied in Engineering. This is the real world of 21st century and this world is run by code. Do you even observe anything around you? 
- Others, while they are interested but haven't spent enough hours on building *the basic most of skills*. Usually, it's after you practice and fail a lot before being able to write the first program on your own. And then you practice a bit more, which is when suddenly you find yourself addicted to see the correct output print on the console. If a BTech pass student spends enough hours and persistance on learning a programming language, he will find himself way ahead of the lakhs and lakhs of engineers that pass out (pun intended) of colleges every year. 
- Some of them wants to flaunt their limited knowledge. They will use a lot of jargons they mugged up a day before the interview. It doesn't take me long to entangle them into their own words. As a foundation to those skillsets, you need to understand some important concepts. And by understand I do not mean _passing the exam understand_. A true attempt has to be made to get some very basic understanding of some of the concepts that have revolutionized the whole world. 

Once you agree with my above points and start out on fixing these right at the time you read this, other issues with your placement can be taken care.
